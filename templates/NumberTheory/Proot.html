		<h2>Problem I - Existence of primitive roots</h2>
		A number \(m\ (m \le 10^12)\) is given. Is there any primitive root modulo \(m\)?

		<h3>Fundamental lemmas</h3>
		Those lemmas will be heavily used in all further paragraphs
		<h4>0 Lemma: \(x^k \equiv 1 \pmod n \iff ord_n(x)|k\)</h4>
		<p>To prove by contradiction \(x^k \equiv 1 \pmod n \implies ord_n(x)|k\): Let \(k\) be miniml such number, such that \(x^k \equiv 1 \pmod n \land ord_n(x) \nmid k\). Either \(k \lt ord_n(x)\) - this cannot be, as \(ord_n(x)\) is minimal number, such that \(x^{ord_n(x)} \equiv 1 \pmod n\); or \(k \gt ord_n(x)\) - then, 
		<span class="central">\(x^k \equiv x^{ord_n(x)} \equiv 1 \pmod n\)</span>
		<span class="central">\(x^{k-ord_n(x)}x^{ord_n(x)} \equiv x^k \equiv 1 \pmod n\)</span>
		<span class="central">\(x^{k-ord_n(x)}*1 \equiv 1 \pmod n\)</span>
		<span class="central">\(x^{k-ord_n(x)} \equiv 1 \pmod n\)</span>
		Which contradicts premise, that \(k\) is minimal number contradicting thesis, because \(k \equiv k-ord_n(x) \pmod {ord_n(x)}\), and so \(ord_n(x) \nmid k-ord_n(x)\)
		</p>
		<p>Second part of the proof: \(ord_n(x)|k \implies x^k \equiv 1 \pmod n\) is here:
		<span class="central">\(x^k=x^{d*ord_n(k)}=(x^{ord_n(k)})^d \equiv 1^d \equiv 1 \pmod n\)</span>
		</p>
		<h4>0.5 Lemma: \(ord_d(y)|ord_{dx}(y)\) (if both exist)</h4>
		<p>
		<span class="central">\(y^{ord_{dx}(y)} \equiv 1 \pmod {dx}\)</span>
		<span class="central">\(y^{ord_{dx}(y)}=1+(mx)d\)</span>
		<span class="central">\(y^{ord_{dx}(y)} \equiv 1 \pmod {d}\)</span>
		And so, from lemma \(0\), \(ord_d(y)|ord_{dx}(y)\)
		</p>

		<h3>Primitive roots existence cases: overwiev</h3>
		<p>First problem quite appropriate to solve before going to the problem itself is: for what \(n\) primitive root exist? There are several cases, which will be covered separately:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>\(n=p\), where \(p\) is a prime</li>
			<li>\(n=p^k\), \(p\) is an odd prime</li>
			<li>\(n=mp^k\), \(gcd(m, p)=1 \land \phi(m) \gt 1 \land p \equiv 1 \pmod 2\) - so, \(m\) is neither \(1\) nor \(2\)</li>
			<li>\(n=2p^k\)</li>
			<li>\(n=2^k, k \ge 3\)</li>
			<li>Remaining cases: \(1, 4\)</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Before Proceeding with those cases, there are two lemmas worth stating, that will be useful throughout all further proofs:</p>

		<h4>First Case of the proof: \(n=p\)</h4>
		<h5>1st Lemma: That equation \(a_0+a_1x+ \dots +a_kx^k \equiv 0 \pmod p\), \(a_k \bmod p \gt 0\) has at most \(k\) solutions \(\bmod p\) - where any \(x \in \lt 0;p-1 \gt\) can be a solution</h5>
		<ol>
			<li>For \(k=0,\ a_0 \gt 0\) this polynominal has no zeros - so one may proceed with inductive proof with assumption that \(\exists_k a_0+ \dots +a_{k-1}x^{k-1} \equiv 0\) has at most \(k-1\) solutions</li>
			<li>Polynominal \(f(x)=a_0+a_1x+ \dots +a_kx^k\) has to have at least \(k+1\) zeros to contradict theorem; suppose it has at least \(k\) zeros \(z_1, \dots, z_k\).</li>
			<li>Then, let \(g(x)=f(x)-a_k(x-z_1)\dots(x-z_k)\). Clearly, every zero of \(f(x)\) is also a zero of \(g(x)\) - so, \(g(x)\) has at least \(k\) zeros - but \(g(x)\) has lower degree than \(f(x)\) - however, by <b>inductive step</b> \(g(x)\) can have at most \(k-1\) zeros or be zero polynominal. What follows, \(g(x) \equiv 0 \pmod p\), so \(f(x) \equiv a_k(x-z_1)\dots(x-z_k) \pmod p\)</li>
			<li>Suppose \(f(x)\) has at least \(k+1\) zeros, let \(z_{k+1}\) be \(k+1\)-st zero. \(f(z_{k+1})=a_k(z_{k+1}-z_1)\dots(z_{k+1}-z_k)\). None of brackets (neither \(a_k\)) is equal to \(0\), because \(\forall_{1 \le i \le k}z_{k+1} \neq z_i\). What follows, \(p\) does not divide any bracket of \(f(z_k)\), so \(p\) does not divide \(f(z_k)\), and so, \(z_{k+1}\) is not a solution of this equation, which finishes lemma.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>It may seem worth a note that this lemma cannot work for not prime modulus - for example, \((x-3)(x-4) \pmod {12}\) has 0, 3, 4 and 7 as its zeros - in case of \(7\) despite \(12\) does not divide any bracket directly, it divides their product - which is possible, because it is not prime, and so \(12\) can be shown as product of certain numbers greater than \(1\). Prime can be shown only as one bracket</p>
		<h5>2nd Lemma: for any \(d:d|\phi(p)=p-1\) equation \(x^d-1 \equiv 0 \pmod p\) has \(d\) solutions</h5>
		<ol>
			<li>Every number \(x: 1 \le x \le p-1\) fulfills: \(x^{\phi(p)} \equiv 1 \pmod p\). And so, \(x^{\phi(p)}-1 \equiv 0 \pmod p\) has \(p-1\) solutions.</li>
			<li>Let \(k\) be such number that \(dk=x\) and \(f(x)=x^{0d}+x^{1d}+ \dots x^{(k-1)d}\). Then \(f(x)(x^d-1)=x^{1d}+x^{2d}+\dots+x^{kd}-x^{0d}-x^{1d}- \dots -x^{(k-1)d}=x^{kd}-1=x^{\phi(p)}-1\)</li>
			<li>Each zero of \(x^{\phi(p)}\) is either zero of \(f(x)\) or zero of \(x^d-1\) (this follows same argument as in lemma above). \(f(x)\) can have at most \(d(k-1)\) zeros (from 1st lemma), so \(x^d-1\) have at least \(d\) zeros, furthermore it cannot have more than \(d\) zeros (from 1st lemma), so it has exactly \(d\) zeros</li>
		</ol>
		<h5>3rd Lemma - If \(\prod_{i=1}^{m} v_i^{q_i}=\phi(p)\), where \(v_i \in P \land q_i \gt 0\), then for each \(v_i^{q_i}\) there is at least one number \(s\), such that \(ord_n(s)=v_i^{q_i}\)</h5>
		<p>From lemma 2, there are \(v_i^{q_i}\) solutions to \(x^{v_i^{q_i}} \equiv 1 \pmod p\). For any solution \(s\), \(ord_p(s)=q^j, j \in \lt 0;q_i \gt\) - this follows from lemma 0, as power of a prime number is divisible only by its lower powers. To exclude all numbers, whose order is \(ord_p(s)=q^j, j \in \lt 0;q_i-1 \gt\), one can exclude all \(v_i^{q_i-1}\) solutions to \(x^{v_i^{q_i-1}} \equiv 1 \pmod p\) - and so, there are \(v_i^{q_i}-v_i^{q_i-1}=\phi(v_i^{q_i}) \gt 0\) such numbers, that \(ord_p(s)=v_i^{q_i}\) </p>
		<h5>4th Lemma - Let \(ord_p(a)=x, ord_p(b)=y\); if \(gcd(x, y)=1\), then \(ord_p(ab)=xy\)</h5>
		<p>Suppose \(ord_p(ab)=m\); then, 
		<span class="central">\(a^{my} \equiv a^{my}(b^{y})^m \equiv (ab)^{my} \equiv ((ab)^m)^y \equiv 1\pmod p\)</span>
		By lemma 0, \(x|my\). Analogously, \(y|mx\). However, \(gcd(x, y)=1\) - so, \(x|m \land y|m\). Minimal \(m\) divisible by both \(x, y\) is \(lcm(x, y)=xy\) - so \(ord_p(ab) \ge xy\).
		<span class="central">\((ab)^{xy} \equiv (a^x)^y(b^y)^x \equiv 1 \pmod p\)</span>
		And so, \(ord_p(ab)=xy\)</p>
		<h5>Theorem - for prime number \(p\) there always exists primitive root.</h5>
		<p>Let \(\phi(p)=v_1^{q_1} \dots v_n^{q_n}\). Let \(s_1, \dots s_n\) be such numbers, such that \(ord_p(s_i)=v_i^{q_i}\) - by lemma 3, such numbers \(s_i\) must exist. Then, \(ord_p(s_1 \dots s_n)=v_1^{q_1} \dots v_n^{q_n}=\phi(p)\) by lemma 4, which finishes the proof.</p>
		<h4>Second case of the proof: \(n=p^k\), where\(p\) is odd</h4>
		<h5>1st Lemma - Either \(g^{\phi(p)}\) or \((g+p)^{\phi(p)}\) cannot be shown as \(mp^2+1\), where \(g\) is primitive root modulo \(p\)</h5>
		<p>Suppose that \(g^{\phi(p)} \equiv 1 \pmod {p^2}\) (otherwise the problem is already solved). Then,
		<span class="central">\((g+p)^{\phi(p)}={ {\phi(p)}\choose{0} }g^{\phi(p)}+{ {\phi(p)}\choose{1} }g^{\phi(p)-1}p^1+{ {\phi(p)}\choose{2} }g^{\phi(p)-2}p^2+ \dots \equiv 1+(p-1)g^{\phi(p)}p+0+\dots \pmod {p^2}\)</span>
		Neither \(p-1\) nor \(g\) have any common divisors with \(p\), so \(p \nmid (p-1)g^{\phi(p)}\) - and so, \((g+p)^{\phi(p)} \neq mp^2+1\).</p>
		<p>It's worth noting that \(g+p\) is primitive root modulo \(p\), because \(g+p \equiv p \pmod p\)</p>
		<h5>2nd lemma - If \(g^{\phi(p^k)} \neq 1+mp^{k+1}\), then \(g^{\phi(p^{k+1})} \neq 1+zp^{k+2}\) for any integers \(m, z\) and \(k \ge 2\)</h5>
		<ol>
			<li>First noteworthy statement is that, by euler's theorem, \(g^{\phi(p^k)}=bp^k+1\) for some integer \(b\)</li>
			<li>From assumption, \(g^{\phi(p^k)} \neq 1+mp^{k+1}\). What follows, \(b \neq mp\), and so, \(p \nmid b\) - for \(m\) can be any integer.</li>
			<li>As \(p\) is odd, it can be show as \(2r+1\)</li>
			<li>\(g^{\phi(p^{k+1})}=g^{\phi(p^k)p}=(1+bp^k)^p={ {p}\choose{0} }1+{ {p}\choose{1} }bp^k+{ {p}\choose{2} }b^2p^{2k}+\dots \equiv 1+bp^{k+1}+\frac{p(p-1)}{2}b^2p^{2k}+\dots \equiv 1+bp^{k+1}+\frac{2r}{2}b^2p^{2k+1}+\dots \equiv 1\pmod {p^{k+2}}\). As \(p \nmid b\), \(g^{\phi(p^{k+1})} \neq zp^{k+2}+1\), which finishes lemma</li>
		</ol>
		<p>It's worth noting that \(3k \lt k+2 \implies k \lt 1\), which cannot be the case by assumption stated on start - and so, all further elements in this sum are equivalent to \(0 \pmod {p^{k+2}}\). Furthermore, this proof won't work for \(p=2\), as in the last equation either \(p\) or \(p-1\) is divisible by \(2\) - in case of \(p=2\), it is \(p\), and so, the third element in sum cannot be reduced to \(0 \pmod {p^{k+2}}\) </p>
		<h5>Theorem - for power of odd prime number \(p^k\) there always exists primitive root.</h5>
		<ol>
			<li>For a prime number primitive root exists, so \(\exists_{k,g} ord_{p^k}(g)=\phi(p^k)\) - this allows constructing proof by induction</li>
			<li>Let \(v=ord_{p^{k+1}}(g)\), where g is a primitive root modulo \(p^k\). Then, \(ord_{p^k}(g)=\phi(p^k)|v\) by lemma 0.5. Also, from lemma 0 and Euler's theorem, \(v|\phi(p^{k+1})\). There can be only two such numbers: \((p-1)p^{k-1}\) and \((p-1)p^k\). 1st lemma allows getting such primitive root, that by 2nd lemma \(g^{\phi(p^{k+1})}\) is not equivalent to \(1 \pmod {p^{k+1}}\) - and so, \(ord_p^{k+1}(g) \neq \phi(p^k)\). What follows, \(ord_{p^{k+1}}(g) = \phi(p^{k+1})\), which finishes the proof.
		</ol>
		<h4>Third case of the proof: \(n=mp^k\), where \(p \nmid m \land \phi(m)>1 \land p \equiv 1 \pmod 2\) </h4>
		<h5>Theorem: for \(n=mp^k\), where \(p \nmid m \land \phi(m)>1 \land p \equiv 1 \pmod 2\) there never exists a primitive root</h5>
		<ol>
			<li>\((\phi(m) \gt 1 \implies 2|\phi(m)) \land (\phi(p^k) \gt 1 \implies 2|\phi(p^k))\) - this comes from totient properties shown in different article.</li>
			<li>\(x^{\phi(mp^k)}=x^{\phi(m)\phi(p^k)}\) - this comes from \(gcd(m, p^k)=1\). The rest of the proof will show that \(x^{\frac{\phi(mp^k)}{2}} \equiv 1 \pmod {mp^k}\)</li>
			<li>\((x^{\phi(m)})^{\frac{\phi(p^k)}{2}} \equiv 1 \pmod m\) - from Euler's theorem</li>
			<li>\((x^{\phi(p^k)})^{\frac{\phi(m)}{2}} \equiv 1 \pmod {p^k}\) - also from Euler's theorem</li>
			<li>From Chinese remainder theorem, there is exactly one number \(y \in \lt 0;mp^k-1 \gt\), such that
				<span class="central">\(y \equiv 1 \pmod m\)</span>
				<span class="central">\(y \equiv 1 \pmod {p^k}\)</span>
				Coincidentally, \(y=1\) solves the equation, and so, \(x^{\frac{\phi(mp^k)}{2}} \equiv 1 \pmod {mp^k}\), so, \(ord_{mp^k}(x) \le \frac{\phi(mp^k)}{2}\) - and the proof ends.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<h4>Fourth case of the proof: \(n=2p^k\), where \(p \equiv 1 \pmod 2\)</h4>
		<h5>Theorem: for \(n=2p^k\), where \(p \equiv 1 \pmod 2\) there always exists primitive root</h5>
		<p>Let \(g\) be a primitive root \(\pmod {p^k}\). Let \(h=g\) if \(g \equiv 1 \pmod {2}\) and \(h=g+p^k\) otherwise (note that \(h\) is odd primitive root \(\pmod {p^k}\), because \(g+p^k \equiv g \pmod {p^k}\)), then \(gcd(h, 2p^k)=1\) (so \(ord_{2p^k}(h)\) exists), and \(ord_{p^k}(h)=\phi(p^k)|ord_{2p^k}(h)\) by lemma 0.5. As \(\phi(2p^k)=\phi(2)\phi(p^k)=\phi(p^k)\), \(ord_{2p^k}(h)=\phi(p^k)=\phi(2p^k)\) which finishes the proof.
		<h4>Fifth case of the proof: \(n=2^k\), where \(k \ge 3\)</h4>
		<h5>Theorem: for \(n=2^k\), where \(k \ge 3\) there never exists a primitive root</h5>
		<ol>
			<li>For \(n=2^3\), one can check all possible primitive roots (\(\phi(2^k)=2^{k-1}\)), so if \(\forall_x ord_{2^3}(x) \lt 4\), then it has no primitive root):
				<span class="central">\(1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod 8\)</span>
				<span class="central">\(3^2=9\equiv 1 \pmod 8\)</span>
				<span class="central">\(5^2=25\equiv 1 \pmod 8\)</span>
				<span class="central">\(7^2=49\equiv 1 \pmod 8\)</span>
				Which shows, that \(2^3\) has no primitive roots and allows to proceed with inductive proof with assumption: \(\exists_k \forall_{x:gcd(x,2)=1} x^{\phi(2^{k-1})}=1+m2^k\) and thesis: \(\forall_{x:gcd(x,2)=1} x^{\phi(2^k)} \equiv 1 \pmod {2^{k+1}}\)
			</li>
			<li>\(2^{\phi(2^k)}=2^{\phi(2^{k-1})2}=(2^{\phi(2^{k-1})})^2=(1+m2^k)^2=1+2m2^k+m^22^{2k}=1+m2^{k+1}+m^22^{2k} \equiv 1+0+0 \equiv 1 \pmod {2^{k+1}}\) - And so, by induction, there are no primitive roots \(\pmod {2^k}\) for \(k \ge 3\), which finishes the proof</li>

		</ol>
		<h4>Remaining cases</h4>
		<p>For \(4\), \(3\) is primitive root. For \(1\), any number is a primitive root straight outta definition.</p>
		<h4>Summing up the cases</h4>
		<p>The numbers having primitive roots are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>\(1, 2, 4\)</li>
			<li>\(p^k\), where \(p \equiv 1 \pmod 2\)</li>
			<li>\(2p^k\), where \(p \equiv 1 \pmod 2\)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>This leads to possibility of an algorithm checking, whether a number has primitive root by checking whether it has proper factorization in \(O(\sqrt{m})\).</p>
		<h2>Problem II: The number of primitive roots modulo \(m\)</h2>
		<p>One can ask, and benefit from asking the question about number of primitive roots \(\pmod m\). It is enough to establish two theses to answer this problem</p>
		<h3>Thesis 1: \(\frac{ord_m(g)}{gcd(ord_m(g), x)}=ord_m(g^x)\)</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>\((g^x)^{ord_m(g^x)} \equiv 1 \equiv g^{ord_m(g)} \pmod m\)</li>
			<li>From lemma 0, \(ord_m(g)|x*ord_m(g^x)\)</li>
			<li>Also, if \(ord_m(g)|xy\), then \(g^{xy} \equiv 1 \pmod m\) - what follows, \(ord_m(g^x)\) must be minimal number, for which \(ord_m(g)|x*ord_m(g^x)\) holds</li>
			<li>If \(ord_m(g)=p_1^{q_1} \dots p_n^{q_n},\ ord_m(g^x)=p_1^{r_1} \dots p_n^{r_n}\) and \(x=p_1^{s_1} \dots p_n^{s_n}t\), where \(t\) is coprime to \(p_1 \dots p_n\), then \(p_1^{q_1} \dots p_n^{q_n} | p_1^{r_1+s_1} \dots p_n^{r_n+s_n}\). So \(r_i\) have to be such numbers, such that \(r_i \ge q_i-min(q_i, s_i)\). As \(r_i\) have to be minimal, then \(p_1^{q_1-min(s_1, q_1)} \dots p_n^{q_n-min(s_n, q_n)}=\frac{p_1^{q_1} \dots p_n^{q_n}}{p_1^{min(s_1, q_1)} \dots p_n^{min(s_n, q_n)}}= \frac{ord_m(g)}{gcd(ord_m(g), x)} =p_1^{r_1} \dots p_n^{r_n}=ord_m(g^x)\), which finishes proof.
		</ol>
		<h3>Thesis 2: if \(g\) is a primitive root \(\pmod m\), then \(\forall_{1 \lt x \lt y \le \phi(m)} g^x \bmod m \neq g^y \bmod m\)</h3>
		<p>Proof by contradiction: \(g^x \equiv g^y \pmod m \implies g^{y-x} \equiv 1 \pmod m\) - but \(y-x \lt \phi(m)\), which contradicts the assumption that \(ord_m(g)=\phi(m)\)</p>
		<h3>Implications of those</h3>
		<p>Suppose that \(g\) is primitive root \(\pmod m\). Then, the question one may ask is: how many there are such numbers \(x\), that \(ord_m(x)=d\) for \(d:d|\phi(m)\)? Certainly, for any number \(y:gcd(y,m)=1\) \(\exists_x g^x \equiv y \pmod m\) - this is from thesis 2, as there are \(\phi(m)\) numbers coprime to \(m\), and for any \(1 \le a, b \le \phi(m)\) \(g^a \bmod m \neq g^b \bmod m\). From thesis 1, \(\frac{ord_m(g)}{gcd(ord_m(g), x)}=ord_m(g^x)\). Using \(ord_m(g)=\phi(m)\), one can get \(\frac{\phi(m)}{gcd(\phi(m), x)}=ord_m(g^x)=d \implies \frac{\phi(m)}{d}=gcd(x, \phi(m))\) - and so, to answer posited question one needs to find number of numbers \(x:gcd(x, \phi(m))=\frac{\phi(m)}{d}=v\). From consequences of totient function, \(|\{x:gcd(m, x)=d\}|=\phi(\frac{m}{d})\). Applying this to the question yields \(|\{x:gcd(\phi(m), x)=\frac{\phi(m)}{d}\}|=\phi(\frac{\phi(m)}{\frac{\phi(m)}{d}})=\phi(d)\) - any primitive root \(g\) has \(ord_m(g)=\phi(m)\), and so, there are \(\phi(\phi(m))\) primitive roots \(\pmod m\)</p>

		<h2>Problem III - Finding primitive root modulo \(m\)</h2>
		<h3>First algorithm</h3>
		<p>One can check, for each subsequent number \(x\) in range \(\lt 1;m-1 \gt\), whether it is primitive root - by taking all numbers \(y\) from range\(\lt 1;\phi(m)-1 \gt\) and checking, whether \(x^y \equiv 1 \pmod m\), and if so, then \(ord_m(x) \lt \phi(m)\) - this can be checked with binary exponentation. This solution works in \(O(Ans*m*log(m))\)</p>
		<h3>Second algorithm</h3>
		<p>From lemma 0 it can be seen, that if \(x^y \equiv 1 \pmod m\), then \(ord_m(a)|y\). \(y=\phi(m)\) fulfills this equation, and so, \(ord_m(a)|\phi(m)\). What follows, one needs to check only divisors \(d:d|\phi(m)\) as exponents to check, whether \(\exists_{y \lt \phi(m)} x^y \equiv 1 \pmod m\). Number of divisors of a number \(y\) can be estimated by \(\sqrt{y}\), and so, this solution works in \(O(Ans*\sqrt{m}*log(m))\)</p>
		<h3>Third algorithm</h3>
		<p>Suppose \(\phi(m)=p_1^{q_1}p_2^{q_2} \dots p_n^{q^n}\) and \(ord_m(x)=p_1^{r_1}p_2^{r_2} \dots p_n^{r_n}\) (from algorithm above, \(ord_m(x)|\phi(m)\)). Either \(\forall_i r_i=q_i\) - then \(x\) is a primitive root - or \(\exists_i r_i \lt q_i\) - then \(x\) is not a primitive root. In the second case, let \(d=p_1^{q_1} \dots p_i^{q_i-1} \dots p_n^{q_n}=\frac{\phi(m)}{p_i}\). Then \(ord_m(x)|d\), because \(\forall_j r_j \le q_j\) and \(r_i \le q_i-1 \lt q_i\). And from lemma 0 \(ord_m(x)|d \implies x^d = x^{\frac{\phi(m)}{p_i}} \equiv 1 \pmod m\). What follows, one can take all primes from factorizing \(\phi(m)\) (whose number may be estimated as \(O(log(\phi(m)))\) or \(O(log(m))\) - and check only for them, whether \(x^{\frac{\phi(m)}{p_i}} \equiv 1 \pmod m\) in order to find out, whether \(x\) is a primitive root. Overall complexity will be \(O(Ans*log(m)*log(m))=O(Ans*log^2(m))\)</p>
		<h3>Fourth algorithm</h3>
		<p>One can, instead of rushing towards finding primitive root, check, whether it can exist by checking factorization of \(m\) - this will change complexity of algorithm to \(O(\sqrt{m}+Ans*log(m)*log(m))\), but will allow efficient runtime for numbers not having primitive root. Furthermore, for numbers in form \(xp^k\), where \(x=1 \lor x=2\), one can find only primitive root \(\pmod p\), and then, using formulas from proofs find primitive root for \(xp^k\) - this will make complexity for \(k \ge 2\) lower (or even acceptable), and allow for very specific optimization in the last algorithm.</p>
		<h3>Reject determinism, embrace probability - last algorithm</h3>
		<p>One can after factorization find primitive roots of \(p\) by subsequently choosing random numbers from interval \(\lt 1;p-1 \gt\) and checking them for being primitive roots in \(O(log^2(p))\). This method is independent of distribution of primitive roots over interval \(\lt 1;p-1 \gt\). Probability that random number from given range is primitive root is \(\frac{\phi(\phi(p))}{p-1}=\frac{\phi(p-1)}{p-1}\).</p>
		<p>One can show, that \(2\frac{\phi(n)}{n} \ge \frac{1}{\log_2(n)}\), or \(\phi(n)\log_2(n) \ge \frac{n}{2}\):
		<span class="central">\(\phi(n)\log_2(n)= n\frac{(p_1-1)(p_2-1) \dots (p_m-1)}{p_1p_2 \dots p_m}*log_2(n) \ge n\frac{(p_1-1)(p_2-1) \dots (p_m-1)}{p_1p_2 \dots p_m}*m \ge \frac{1*2 \dots m}{2*3 \dots (m+1)} m = n\frac{m}{m+1} \ge \frac{n}{2}\)</span>
		<p>So, probability, that drawn number is a primitive root is not lower than \(\frac{1}{2\log_2(n)}\). After how many moves the probability of drawing primitive root will be higher than \(\frac{1}{2}\)? When probability, that no primitive root was drawn in last \(k\) moves will be lower than \(\frac{1}{2}\). This probability after \(k\) moves is lower than \((\frac{2log_2(n)-1}{2log_2(n)})^k\). To do anything with this equation, it is wise to know the cult-classic definition of Euler number.</p>
		<p>As \(\lim_{n -\gt \infty} (\frac{n-1}{n})^n=\frac{1}{e} \lt \frac{1}{2}\), this allows to estimate expected number of operations of given algorithm by \(O(log^3(m))\) without factorization, and the algorithm will terminate with probability \(2^{-l}\) in expected number of steps being at most \(O(l*\log^3(n))\) (note that if probability, that in \(kl\) random numbers there will be no primitive roots is \(p^{kl}\) - and if probability, that after \(k\) steps there will be no primitive root found is \(\le \frac{1}{2}\), then the probability of not finding primitive root in \(kl\) steps is \((p^k)^l \le (\frac{1}{2})^l\)).</p>

			<p>It\'s worth noting You can change, whether the algorithm checks numbers:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Deterministically: algorithm checks subsequent natural numbers from \(2\) to \(p-1\) whether they\'re primitive roots.</li>
				<li>Probabilistically: algorithm checks random numbers from interval \(\lt 2;p-1 \gt\) whether they\'re primitive roots. Note that 200 numbers are randomly generated after calculating exponents and they cannot change during the algorithm - unless You clicked "prev" before drawing 2nd random number (it\'s implementational nuissance)</li>

			<p>Of course, number written on the input at start was not coincidentally chosen: \(21\) is the least positive integer being primitive root of 409, so deterministic approach will be almost certainly slower than probabilistic</p>
			<p>Input format: One number \(m\), such that primitive root modulo \(m\) has to be found<br>

		<h2>Summary</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>A number has a primitive root if and only if it can be represented as \(1, 2, 4, p^k\) or \(2p^k\), where \(p\) is odd prime number.</li>
			<li>If one primitive root modulo \(m\) exists, then there are \(\phi(\phi(m))\) primitive roots modulo \(m\).</li>
			<li>One can find primitive root in expected number of operations not higher than \(O(log^3(m))+O(fac(m))\), where \(fac(m)\) denotes time to factorize \(m\).</li>
