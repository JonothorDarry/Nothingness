		<h3>The notion of combinatorics</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Combinatorics is concerned with counting objects - or asking question "how many unique &lt;Insert some structure(set, sequence, partition etc.)&gt; there exist with elements from a certain multiset of objects satisfying certain conditions"</li>
			<li>Most problem solutions from combinatorics can be reduced to dynamic programming solution (or all, depending on interpretation of what dp is)</li>
			<li>Usually solutions to combinatorical problems, that are interesting involve huge numbers (certainly larger than 64 bits). In order to make them solvable without coping with big integer arithmetic, most problems have to be solved \(mod\ p\), where \(p\) is certain number, most probably prime (so that for each number \(1 \le x \lt p\) its inverse exists), possibly either \(998244353=2^{23}*7*17+1\) (this allows reasonable amount of layers in NTT) or \(10^9+7\).</li>
			<li>Often most insightful proof for some combinatorical thesis is combinatorical proof. It consists either of showing that size of the same set can be calculated in two ways (double counting), or that there exists bijective function between sets \(A, B\) - thus establishing, that \(|A|=|B|\) (if sizes of boths sets are finite)</li>
		</ol>

		<h3>Further statements about this article</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>This artcle is focused on ideas, not computation - so there will be no extensive calculations and no modular arithmetics.</li>
			<li>Most ideas present in this article will focus on quite fundamental question - there are \(t\) types of objects, objects of same type are indistinguishable. for \(i\)-th type of object, there are \(a_i\) such objects (so number of all objects is \(n=\sum_{i=1}^{t}a_i\) - if all \(a_i\) are finite). How many there are unique sets/sequences of size \(k\) consisting of those objects?</li>
			<li>Firstly, the solution to problems above is stated; then, the proofs of those solutions are shown. Besides, this article also shows several more-or-less fundamental equalities concernig binomial coefficient \(\binom{n}{k}\)</li>

		<h3>Permutation</h3>
		<p>Question: How many sequences of size \(n\) of \(n\) distinct elements exist? For example, for \(n=3\) there are: \([1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2,1,3], [2,3,1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1]\) - and so, there are \(6\) such sequences.</p>
		<p>Solution: Let's denote a solution to this problem for a given \(n\) as \(dp(n)\). Then, \(dp(0)=1\) - because empty sequence is a valid solution. One can observe, that each solution for \(n\) is some solution for \(n-1\) with one element added at some point in sequence: for example, for \(n=4\) and solution \([2,3,1]\) for \(n-1=3\), next solutions obtained from this solution are \([4,2,3,1],[2,4,3,1],[2,3,4,1],[2,3,1,4]\). It's worth noting that solutions obtained from single, smaller solution have unique order of elements between \(1;n-1\) - so, all new solutions are unique. There are \(n\) possible points in the sequence, where one can insert an element - this leads to establish \(dp(n)=dp(n-1)*n\). One can see, that 
		<span class="central">\(dp(n)=n*dp(n-1)=n(n-1)*dp(n-2)= \dots = n(n-1)(n-2) \dots 1=\prod_{i=1}^{n}i=n!\)</span>
		</p>

		<h3>Permutation with repetitions</h3>
		<p>Question: How many sequences of size \(n\) of \(n\) objects, each belonging to one of \(t\) distinct element types exist (elements from one type are indistinguishable)? For example, for \(t=2\) and subsequent numbers of objects of certain types: \(a=[2, 2]\) the sequences are: \([1, 1, 2, 2], [1, 2, 1, 2], [1, 2, 2, 1], [2, 1, 1, 2], [2, 1, 2, 1], [2, 2, 1, 1]\) - and so, there are \(6\) such sequences.</p>
		<p>Solution: One can start by assuming, that objects of same type are possible to distinguish: this leads to \(n!\) sequences, some of them being identical. Let subsequent letters denote type of an object, and numbers - number of an object within a type (that doesn't exist in reality, only in terms of created sequences, as objects of same type are indistinguishable). For example, for \(t=3\) and \(a=[3,2,2]\) some of the resulting sequences are \([a1, c2, a3, b2, a2, c1, b1]\) or \([a3, c1, b2, c2, a1, a2, b3]\). Then, one can observe, that with same positions of same - say \(i\)-th type - there are \(a_i!\) sequences from single sequence with indistinguishable elements of this type, that become distinct after enumerating elements of this type. For example, after enumerating elements from type \(a\):<br>
		$$
		[a, b1, c1, b2, a, a, c2] \iff 
			\begin{cases}
				[a1, b1, c1, b2, a2, a3, c2] \\
				[a1, b1, c1, b2, a3, a2, c2] \\
				[a2, b1, c1, b2, a1, a3, c2] \\
				[a2, b1, c1, b2, a3, a1, c2] \\
				[a3, b1, c1, b2, a1, a2, c2] \\
				[a3, b1, c1, b2, a2, a1, c2] \\
			\end{cases}
		$$
		This comes from permutation of elements of same type. So, if one denotes solution to the problem by \(sol\), then:
		</p>
		<span class="central">\(sol*a_1!a_2! \dots a_t!=n!\)</span>
		<span class="central">\(sol=\frac{n!}{\prod_{i=1}^{t}a_i!}\)</span>
		{{ algo.algorithm(2, 'Permutation with Repetitions', '
		<p>Input format: \(t\) - number of types, then sequence \(a_1, \dots, a_t\) - number of object from subsequent types. Note, that \(n=\sum_{i=1}^{t}a_i\)<br>
