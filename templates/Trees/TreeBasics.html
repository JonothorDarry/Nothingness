		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>In this article two techniques of solving tree related problems will be shown - penetrating the tree from bottom to top in order to get information from the subtree, and penetrating the tree twice from bottom to top and then from top to bottom in order to get some information about the whole tree in every vertex of a tree. To avoid misconceptions, some definitions have to be stated:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><b>Simple path</b> is a path in a graph that passes through any edge at most once.</li>
			<li><b>Tree</b> is an undirected graph, such that between each two vertices there is exactly one simple path. This implies that the graph is acyclic (because cycle allows to move from one vertex to another in more than one way) and connected (because there is a way to move from any vertex to another). It is crucial to show, that such graph have \(n-1\) edges, where \(n\) is number of vertexes. One can consider a tree to be a generalization of a sequence.</li>
			<li><b>Root</b> is a vertex in the tree, relative to which its vertexes are described - usually it doesn't matter, which vertex is treated as root, while describing vertices relatively to some other vertex (called root) allows performing certain operations on a tree (like finding lowest common ancestor of 2 vertices).</li>
			<li><b>Depth</b> is the distance in the tree from the root to a given vertex.</li>
			<li><b>Parent</b> of a vertex \(x\) is a vertex \(y\) with lower depth such that there exists edge between \(x\) and \(y\) (later denoted as \(x-y\)). There cannot be two such vertices - if they were, then there would be two simple paths \(x-root\). Also, for each vertex different than root there is such vertex - otherwise, there would be no path \(x-root\). Number of edges leading from vertex to it's parent is therefore \(n-1\), and each vertex has only one path to the root - therefore, each edge leads between parent and its son - otherwise, an edge would allow existence of two paths between root and some vertex. What follows, tree with \(n\) vertices has \(n-1\) edges.</li>
			<li><b>Descendant</b> of a vertex \(x\) is any vertex \(y\) with higher depth, such that \(x\) lies on simple path \(y-root\).</li>
			<li><b>Child</b> of a vertex \(x\) is any such descendant \(y\) of \(x\), that there is an edge \(x-y\).</li>
			<li><b>Subtree</b> of a vertex \(x\) is a set of all verices that are descendants of vertex \(x\) including \(x\).</li>
			<li><b>Overtree</b> of a vertex \(x\) is a set of all verices in a tree that do not belong to its subtree (name is used in this article only for convenience). </li>
		</ol>

		<h2>First Problem statement and definitions</h2>
		<p>Suppose you want to solve the following problem: a tree of \(n\) vertices is given, \(n \le 10^6\), and You have to find the length of the longest simple path in this tree (also called diameter).</p>

		<h3>Solution 0: Basic tree properties in \(O(n^2)\)</h3>
		<p>One could solve this problem with absolute brute force, by counting longest distance from any vertex in tree, for example with standard breadth first search - solution works in \(O(n^2)\).</p>
		<h3>Solution 1: Using dp in \(O(n)\)</h3>
		<p>However, one can see, that each path in the tree moves through some vertex with lowest depth - if a path would lead through distinct vertexes \(x, y\) with same depth then a path must move through parent of \(x\) (because it must lie on a path \(x-y\)). So, one can just keep two lengths of longest paths starting in \(x\) ending in its subtree to know the longest path, whose vertex with lowest depth is \(x\). Thus:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Later, set of children of \(x\) will be denoted as \(S_x\)</li>
			<li>Let \(d_0(x), d_1(x)\) denote lengths of two longest paths starting at \(x\), ending in its subtree, passing through its different children - at the start of the algorithm, \(d_0(x) = d_1(x) = 0\) for all \(x \in V\)</li>
			<li>\(d_0(x) = \max\{y \in S_x: d_0(y)+1\}\) - because a longest path from \(x\) to its subtree crosses one of its children, and uses additional edge between child and \(x\).</li>
			<li>Analogously, \(d_1(x) = \max_2\{y \in S_x: d_0(y)+1\}\), where \(\max_2\) denotes second maximal value.</li>
			<li>For leaf, \(d_0(x) = d_1(x) = 0\), also if a vertex has one child, then \(d_1(x) = 0\)</li>
			<li>Finally, \(diameter = max \{x \in X: d_0(x) + d_1(x)\}\).</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
		This allows to construct an algorithm by updating \(d_0, d_1\) of subsequent vertices after processing all its children. How to process the tree though?
		</p>
		<h4>Depth first search</h4>
		<p>To penetrate the tree one can:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Start moving through a tree from root.</li>
			<li>If a vertex \(x\) has any unchecked descendant \(y\), go to it, check it, and mark \(parent_y=x\).</li>
			<li>Otherwise, change aggregated data of the parent and go back to it.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
		One can use some queue, to which one will append element if it's an unchecked descendant of the last element and pop element when there are no descendants unpenetrated. This allows aggregating data from the subtree of a vertex, such as longest paths starting in a vertex and going down the tree. Such queue is usually called 'stack', and algorithm - 'depth first search'. This allows constructing algorithm solving problem above in \(O(n)\).

		<h2>Second problem</h2>
		<p>
		Suppose, however, that another problem is given. You are given a tree of \(n\) vertices with \(m\) vertices marked (\(1 \le m \le n \le 10^6\)), and your objective is to find for each vertex maximal distance from it to any marked vertex.
		</p>
		<h3>Solution - double tree walk</h3>
		<p>
		If a vertex with maximal distance from a given vertex \(v\):
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Lies in the subtree of \(v\) - then one can obtain the distance just like diameter in task before, by searching whole subtree and aggregating information from it.</li>
			<li>Lies in the overtree of \(v\) - then one can obtain the distance from its parent after first search. Note, that longest path to a marked vertex from \(parent_x\) may pass through \(x\) - one can keep two longest paths to marked vertices along with a vertex they came from in order to circumvent this problem.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>These observations imply algorithm in which a vertex \(v\) will:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Get information from its subtree, so that any vertex will have information from subtree, and so root will have full information about maximal distance from it to any marked vertex - for every vertex lies in its subtree.</li>
			<li>Get an information from \(parent_v\) about longest path to marked vertex - and so, parent must have an answer before son. What follows, root is the first vertex, that will contain an answer, then its children, children of children, etc.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>And so, one can apply identical algorithm as to the problem of a diameter finding, but after finding an answer for a root go down through the tree and find answer for subsequent sons as a maximal distance from them to any marked vertex in subtree and distance from its parent to any marked vertex in subtree not containing \(v\) or overtree. Such algorithm will consist of two walks on a tree - one, in which the distance is aggregated from sons to parents, and second, when answer is populated from parents to sons.</p>
		<h3>Solution nuance - inverse preorder</h3>
		<p>One can see, that a second dfs (depth first search) is redundant - one can store a sequence of subsequent visited vertexes, starting from root and then update longest distance to marked vertex, updating subsequent elements from this array - it works, because in dfs parent is always visited before child.

		<h2>Summary</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>In order to learn something about certain property of the whole tree, it might be enough to do a single dfs-like traversal through the whole tree, while aggregating information from subtrees.</li>
			<li>In order to learn about a property of all vertices in a tree, where property can depend both on subtree and overtree, one can do two traversals of the tree: from bottom to top, and then from top to bottom.</li>
			<li>Doing dfs on the whole tree to get a property of a tree is usually an unnecessary chore - one can do a single dfs to define parenthood, list the vertices in the order of an inverse preorder, and then get an information about a vertex from traversing this list in some direction.</li>
