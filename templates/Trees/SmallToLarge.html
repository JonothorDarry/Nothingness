			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>In this article, a technique for solving problems needing aggregation of a large amount of data in a single vertex will be shown.</p>
			<h2>Problem I: What is the most common color in a subtree?</h2>
			<p>Let's say we are given a rooted tree of size \(n\), where \(n \le 3*10^6\). Each vertex v is assigned a color \(c(v)\). For each vertex, what is the most common color of a vertex within its subtree? In case there are many such colors, print any.</p>
			<h3>Solution: path decomposition</h3>
			<p>First, for a vertex in a rooted tree, we can divide vertices in the subtree of some vertex \(x\) (except itself) into two groups:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Vertices lying below a child of \(x\) with the biggest subtree size.</li>
				<li>Rest of vertices in its subtree.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Note, that only the first group (descendants of a child with biggest subtree size) can have size bigger than \(\frac{|subtree(x)|}{2}\)</p>

			<p>This allows to construct the following algorithm: for each vertex:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Iterate over its children in order of ascending subtree sizes (or in any other order, as long, as the largest subtree is processed as the last).</li>
				<li>For all the children except the last one - after processing them, discard the auxiliary results.</li>
				<li>For the last child: the auxiliary result is retained by the parent, then all the information from the remaining subtrees is retained in some way. The result is obtained using auxiliary data.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>In case of this problem, "auxiliary data" can mean a table with counts of particular colors along with the color most often occuring in a subtree, changing whenever some color obtains a higher count. </p>

			<p>Note, that each vertex vertex will be processed at most \(\log_2(n)+1\) times:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Let's call the all the edges going from a vertex to its children except the child with the largest subtree 'light edges' and the reamining edges 'heavy edges'.</li>
				<li>The vertex will be processed as many times, as there are light edges on the path from itself to the root plus one time (for a single processing related with going up the 'heavy edge').</li>
				<li>If a vertex \(x\) is connected with a parent \(par(x)\) using the light edge, the size of the subtree of \(x\) is at least two times smaller than the size of the subtree of \(par(x)\) - because there is a child of \(par(x)\) with not smaller subtree than \(x\).</li>
				<li>What follows, if a path from the root to a vertex \(x\) has \(k\) light edges, then the tree has not less than \(2^k\) vertices.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Thus, there are at most \(\log_2(n)\) light edges between root and any vertex - and the vertex will be processed at most \(\log_2(n)+1\) times.</p>

			<h2>Problem II - Aggregation from multiple subtrees</h2>
			<p>Let's say a rooted tree is given, where the label of a parent of a vertex \(v\) is lower than \(v\) (that is, \(par(v) \lt v\)). Each vertex \(v\) has assigned a color \(c(v)\). Let \(amount\_colors(\psi)\) describe the amount of colors in a single connected component \(\psi\). Let 
			$$ f(x) = \sum_{\psi} amount\_colors(\psi) $$,
			where all the edges from vertices with a label lower than \(x\) to their parents are removed. Find \(f(2), f(3), \dots, f(n+1)\). Constraint: \(n \le 3*10^5\).
			</p>
			<h3>Solution - pure small-to-large</h3>
			<p>We will find answers from largest argument to lowest argument - i.e. first find \(f(n+1)\), then \(f(n)\), then \(\dots\), then \(f(2)\).</p>
			<p>Note, that \(f(n+1) = n\) - because there are \(n\) connected components, each consists of a single unique color. For any \(k \in \{2, 3, \dots, n\}\), $$ f(k) = f(k+1) - unique(cc_{k+1}(k)) - unique(cc_{k+1}(par(k))) + unique(cc_k(k)) $$,
			where \(cc_k(v)\) describes connected component of a vertex \(v\) if all edges from vertices with labels lower than \(k\) to their parents are removed, while \(unique(cc)\) describes the amount of unique colors of a conected component \(cc\) - the sum of amounts of unique components changes only with respect to two components, which will be merged into one.</p>
			<p>So, in essence, this task can be boiled down to: merge two sets into one in order to get a single result, which needs to be calculated using the size of this set. </p>
			<p>One can always insert elements from a smaller set to a larger set, and then, if the larger set is related to a parent, swap them quickly (probably by reference - it's an implementational detail). Note, that if a swap occurs in \(O(1)\), and an insertion/query in \(O(\log n)\), then this solution works in \(O(n \log^2(n))\) - because each time a color is added to a set, it becomes a part of at least two times larger set - so, each color can only be inserted \(O(\log(n)\) times to some set. As there are \(n\) elements, the complexity is bound by \(O(n \log(n) * insert\_query\_complexity(n))\). as we insert or query each element in \(O(\log(n))\), the overall complexity is equal to \(O(n\log^2(n))\).</p>

			<h2>Problem III: Amount of paths of length \(k\)</h2>
			<p>Let's say some tree with \(n\) vertexes is given: how many there are simple paths in this tree of length \(k\), where \(k \le n \le 10^7\).</p>
			<h3>Solution: Guess what? Small-to-large</h3>
			<p>In each vertex \(x\), a sequence \(dist_x\) will be kept - indexed from 0, elemens \(dist_{x,i}\) holds an answer to a question: how many there are vertices in a subtree of the vertex \(x\), at a distance \(mx-i\) from the vertex \(x\), where \(mx\) denotes distance from the vertex \(x\) to the deepest vertex in its subtree.</p>
			<p>The answer will be computed by adding 
			$$\sum_{i=0}^{mx}dist_{x,i}*dist_{par(x),k-i-1}$$
			to the result before each merge, where \(mx\) refers to the length of a shorter sequence. Note, that each path in a tree passes through a single vertex with a lowest depth, and \(dist_par(x)\) stores information about one arc of this path - \(x\) stores information about the second part of the path, descending from \(x\). All paths will be counted only once, because merge occurs after changing the result.</p>
			<p>The merge step works as usual, the sequence with greater length is considered "bigger"; as instead of sets this method operates on sequences, the complexity related to adding a single element to the set above is \(O(1)\) - which limits the complexity to \(O(\log(n))\).</p>
			<p>One may go even further in estimating the complexity - Let's call the first vertex responsible for increasing \(dist_{x,i}\) to be an \(i\)-leader for this sequence. Note, that a vertex can become a leader within only a single sequence - if the value \(dist_{x, i}\) is passed to the other sequence, then its length was greater or equal - there is already an \(i\)-leader in this sequence, and if equal, then \(par(i)\) becomes an \(mx\)-leader for this sequence (where \(mx\) deontes legth of the greater sequence after merging).</p>

			<h2>Summary</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>A problem, where one is asked to aggregate a large amount of information (perhaps linears by the size of the tree) can often be solved using a small-to-large aggregation technique.</li>
				<li>Small-to-large algorithm can be implemented using decomposition of a tree into heavy edges and light edges and keeping global data, erasing parts of it and adding them later, working in \(O(n \log(n))\) (or similar complexity, depending on used data structures).</li>
				<li>If the tree is not given explicitly or it has to be done with incomplete information (online), standard small-to-large technique - merging sets (or other data structures), each of which is associated with a single vertex, in such a way, that the smaller set is added to the larger set might come in handy. It often works in \(O(n \log(n) * qi(n))\), where \(qi(n)\) describes time needed to insert something to a data structure; though it may work in \(O(n)\), for example in counting amount of paths of length \(k\).</li>
