			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>In this article, a technique for solving problems needing aggregation of a large amount of data in a single vertex will be shown.</p>
			<h2>Problem I: What is the most common color in a subtree?</h2>
			<p>Let's say we are given a rooted tree of size \(n\), where \(n \le 3*10^6\). Each vertex v is assigned a color \(c(v)\). For each vertex, what is the most common color of a vertex within its subtree? In case there are many such colors, print any.</p>
			<h3>Solution: path decomposition</h3>
			<p>First, for a vertex in a rooted tree, we can divide vertices in the subtree of some vertex \(x\) (except itself) into two groups:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Vertices lying below a child of \(x\) with the biggest subtree size.</li>
				<li>Rest of vertices in its subtree.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Note, that only the first group (descendants of a child with biggest subtree size) can have size bigger than \(\frac{|subtree(x)|}{2}\)</p>

			<p>This allows to construct the following algorithm: for each vertex:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Iterate over its children in order of ascending subtree sizes (or in any other order, as long, as the largest subtree is processed as the last).</li>
				<li>For all the children except the last one - after processing them, discard the auxiliary results.</li>
				<li>For the last child: the auxiliary result is retained by the parent, then all the information from the remaining subtrees is retained in some way. The result is obtained using auxiliary data.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>In case of this problem, "auxiliary data" can mean a table with counts of particular colors along with the color most often occuring in a subtree, changing whenever some color obtains a higher count. </p>

			<p>Note, that each vertex vertex will be processed at most \(\log_2(n)+1\) times:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Let's call the all the edges going from a vertex to its children except the child with the largest subtree 'light edges' and the reamining edges 'heavy edges'.</li>
				<li>The vertex will be processed as many times, as there are light edges on the path from itself to the root plus one time (for a single processing related with going up the 'heavy edge').</li>
				<li>If a vertex \(x\) is connected with a parent \(par(x)\) using the light edge, the size of the subtree of \(x\) is at least two times smaller than the size of the subtree of \(par(x)\) - because there is a child of \(par(x)\) with not smaller subtree than \(x\).</li>
				<li>What follows, if a path from the root to a vertex \(x\) has \(k\) light edges, then the tree has not less than \(2^k\) vertices.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Thus, there are at most \(\log_2(n)\) light edges between root and any vertex - and the vertex will be processed at most \(\log_2(n)+1\) times.</p>

			<h2>Problem II - Aggregation from multiple subtrees</h2>
			<p>Let's say a rooted tree is given, where the label of a parent of a vertex \(v\) is lower than \(v\) (that is, \(par(v) \lt v\)). Each vertex \(v\) has assigned a color \(c(v)\). Let \(amount\_colors(\psi)\) describe the amount of colors in a single connected component \(\psi\). Let 
			$$ f(x) = \sum_{\psi} amount\_colors(\psi) $$,
			where all the edges from vertices with a label lower than \(x\) to their parents are removed. Find \(f(2), f(3), \dots, f(n+1)\). Constraint: \(n \le 3*10^5\).
			</p>
			<h3>Solution - pure small-to-large</h3>
			<p>We will find answers from largest argument to lowest argument - i.e. first find \(f(n+1)\), then \(f(n)\), then \(\dots\), then \(f(2)\).</p>
			<p>Note, that \(f(n+1) = n\) - because there are \(n\) connected components, each consists of a single unique color. For any \(k \in \{2, 3, \dots, n\}\), $$ f(k) = f(k+1) - unique(cc_{k+1}(k)) - unique(cc_{k+1}(par(k))) + unique(cc_k(k)) $$,
			where \(cc_k(v)\) describes connected component of a vertex \(v\) if all edges from vertices with labels lower than \(k\) to their parents are removed, while \(unique(cc)\) describes the amount of unique colors of a conected component \(cc\) - the sum of amounts of unique components changes only with respect to two components, which will be merged into one.</p>
			<p>So, in essence, this task can be boiled down to: merge two sets into one in order to get a single result, which needs to be calculated using the size of this set. </p>
			<p>One can always insert elements from a smaller set to a larger set, and then, if the larger set is related to a parent, swap them quickly (probably by reference - it's an implementational detail). Note, that if a swap occurs in \(O(1)\), and an insertion/query in \(O(\log n)\), then this solution works in \(O(n \log^2(n))\) - because each time a color is added to a set, it becomes a part of at least two times larger set - so, each color can only be inserted \(O(\log(n)\) times to some set. As there are \(n\) elements, the complexity is bound by \(O(n \log(n) * insert\_query\_complexity(n))\). as we insert or query each element in \(O(\log(n))\), the overall complexity is equal to \(O(n\log^2(n))\).</p>
